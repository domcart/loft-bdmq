oooooh
(snow falls gently)
[verse 1 - Winter's Tale]
Under the lights, we find our way
Every step a softer sway
Hearts whisper, like snowflakes fall
In this warmth, we have it all
mmmmmmmmm
[Pre-Chorus - Embrace]
(soft echo)
Hold me close, in the chill
Every moment stands still
[Chorus - Frosted Dreams]
wooooo
In your eyes, I see the glow
Dreams of us in the falling snow
iiiiiiiiiiii
[Bridge - Silent Night]
oooo aaaah
Wrapped in the night’s embrace
Every touch, a gentle trace
Ffffttttt
[outro - Whispered Melody]
Softly, softly, the night sings
In this moment, we are kings
ahhhhhhhh
(whisper fades)
